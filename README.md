# Language Flags

I worked on a project where I needed flags for different languages. Many countries speak the same language, so it was hard to pick which flag to use. For example, lots of countries speak Arabic, but I used the Saudi Arabia flag to represent Arabic. The same goes for Spanish - many countries speak Spanish, but I used the Spain flag to show it. I did this for each main language.

Thank you for understanding.
